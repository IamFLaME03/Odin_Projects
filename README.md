# Odin_Projects
Here I save all odin program projects developed by Me.  

## 1. [odin-recipes](https://iamflame03.github.io/Odin_Projects/odin-recipes/index.html)
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

## 2. [landing-page](https://iamflame03.github.io/Odin_Projects/landing-page/index.html)
landing page created according to :

## 3. [rock_paper_scissors](https://iamflame03.github.io/Odin_Projects/rock_paper_scissors/index.html)
This game will be played entirely in the console.
The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it.

## 4. 
I build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
