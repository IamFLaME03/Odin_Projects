    <p><strong class="uline">Steps to Prepare Recipe:</strong>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until
        softened (about 2 minutes). Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Add the Mixed Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Add the mixed vegetables to the skillet and cook until they're tender-crisp (about 2-3 minutes).</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Push the Vegetables Aside</h3>
    <p>Push the vegetables to one side of the skillet. Crack in the beaten eggs and scramble them until cooked through.
        Mix the eggs with the vegetables.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Add the Cooked Rice</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked rice to the skillet, breaking up any clumps with a spatula. Stir-fry the rice with the vegetables
        and eggs for about 2-3 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Add the Sauces and Seasonings</h3>
    <p>Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir-fry everything together for
        another minute.</p>
    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Garnish</h3>
    <p>Serve the Vegetable Fried Rice hot, garnished with chopped scallions (if desired). Enjoy!</p>
