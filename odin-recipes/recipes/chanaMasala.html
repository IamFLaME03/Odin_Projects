    <p><strong class="uline">Steps to Prepare Recipe:</strong>
    <h3>Step 1: Mix the Spices</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the cumin, coriander, turmeric, red chili powder, and garam masala powder.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Onions and Garlic</h3>

    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until they're lightly
        browned (about 5 minutes). Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Tomatoes and Spices</h3>

    <p>Add the diced tomatoes, spice mix, and salt to the pan. Mix well and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the tomatoes
        are soft and the mixture smells good.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Chickpeas and Water</h3>

    <p>Add the chickpeas, 1 cup of water, and butter to the pan. Mix well and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low
        and let it simmer, covered, for 20-25 minutes, or until the chickpeas are tender and the gravy has thickened.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Garnish</h3>

    <p>Serve the Chana Masala hot, garnished with fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice (if desired). Enjoy with
        rice or roti!</p>
