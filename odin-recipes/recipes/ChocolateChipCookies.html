    </p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Optional: nuts (walnuts or pecans work well)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Steps to Prepare Recipe:</strong>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prep</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy (about 2-3
        minutes).</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Add the Eggs</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Mix in the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually mix in the dry ingredients (flour mixture) until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</p>
    <h3>Step 6: Stir in the Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Stir in the chocolate chips and nuts (if using).</p>
    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between
        each cookie. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown.</p>
    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a
        wire rack to cool completely.</p>
    <h3>Tips and Variations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For chewier cookies, bake for 8-10 minutes. For crisper cookies, bake for 12-14 minutes.</li>
        <li>Try adding different types of chocolate chips (milk chocolate, white chocolate, or dark chocolate) for a
            unique flavor.</li>
        <li>Add-ins like dried cranberries, chopped peanut butter cups, or espresso powder can add exciting twists to
            the classic recipe.
